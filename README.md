##[Download the GAPS Support Tool](gapstool.exe?raw=true)

This tool collects logs and information from all Domain Controllers running [Google Apps Password Sync](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2611859) in order to allow reviewing them all in a single place to make troubleshooting easier.

It's built using VBScript for compatibility with all Windows versions, with a thin wrapper built using [AutoIt](http://www.autoitscript.com/site/) to save it as an EXE file.
